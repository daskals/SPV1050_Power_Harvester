# SPV1050_Power_Harvester
Ultralow power energy harvester and battery charger


The SPV1050 is an ultra-low power and high-efficiency power manager embedding four MOSFETs for boost 
or buck-boost DC-DC converter and an additional transistor for the load connection/disconnection. 
An internal high accuracy MPPT algorithm can be used to maximize the power extracted from PV panel or TEG.
